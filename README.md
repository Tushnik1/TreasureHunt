# TreasureHunt
This is the first real life full stack project made by me for the college fest, Treasure Hunt Event. 
From the start to completing this project have helped me to learn so many new things also how to host your files online.

It is hosted online you can use this link to see: http://enginerds2k23treasurehunt.000.pe/Login/register.html (Here you have to first register with a userName and password).
Then use this link to start the hunt: http://enginerds2k23treasurehunt.000.pe/Login/login.html

The resources or languages used are HTML, CSS for frontend and PHP is used in backend programming.The database used here is MySQL.

Hope you enjoy exploring this project.


Update;
Since, 11/12/2024.
All the previous files of PHP are replaced by the newly created React Stack.
